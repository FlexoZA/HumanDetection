### Capacitive Touch Button with 10-Second Safety Delay
```
Touch Button   ESP32 Pin
Capacitive ‚Üí   GPIO 33 (capacitive touch sensor)
GND Reference ‚Üí GND (required for capacitive sensing)
```

**üõ°Ô∏è Safety Feature: Smart 10-Second Delay**
- **To ARM**: Touch + release finger ‚Üí 10-second countdown begins (progressive purple loading)
- **To DISARM**: Touch + release finger ‚Üí **immediate** disarm (no delay)
- **Cancel**: Touch again during countdown to cancel arming
- **LED Priority**: Countdown visuals override standby rainbow during arming
- Prevents accidental arming, allows instant disarming

## **Plastic Enclosure Setup:**

**‚úÖ RECOMMENDED - Single Touch (One Finger):**
```
ESP32 GPIO 33 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Conductive Pad (touch electrode)
ESP32 GND ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Separate Conductive Pad (ground reference)
```
- Touch one conductive pad with one finger
- Your body provides the capacitive connection
- Simple and reliable

**‚ùå NOT RECOMMENDED - Two Touch (Two Fingers):**
- ESP32 capacitive touch is designed for single-touch detection
- Two-finger detection is unreliable and complex
- Use single touch instead

**‚ùå WRONG - Single Wire (Shorted):**
```
ESP32 GPIO 33 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Same Wire ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ GND (creates short circuit!)
```

### Future Expansion (Planned)

```

## System Operation

### Boot Sequence
1. **Rainbow Chase Effect** - Indicates successful system initialization
2. **System Mode**: DISARMED (continuous rainbow display)
3. **Auto-arm Timer**: Starts 10-minute countdown

### DISARMED Mode (Default)
- **Visual**: Continuous flowing rainbow effect on all LEDs
- **Behavior**: Movement detection disabled for alerts
- **Auto-arm**: Switches to ARMED after 10 minutes of no movement
- **Purpose**: Ambient lighting when residents are present

### ARMED Mode (Security Active)
- **Visual**: LEDs off when idle (stealth mode)
- **Behavior**: Full detection sequence active
- **Auto-disarm**: Currently disabled (requires manual disarm in future)
- **Purpose**: Security monitoring when area should be vacant

### Detection Sequence (ARMED Mode Only)

#### Stage 1: Initial Detection (1 second)
- **Visual**: White LEDs loading progressively (16 LEDs in 1 second)
- **Trigger**: First movement detected
- **Notification**: None (false positive prevention)

#### Stage 2: Continued Presence (1 second)
- **Visual**: Orange LEDs loading progressively
- **Trigger**: Movement continues from Stage 1
- **Notification**: None (still filtering false positives)

#### Stage 3: Sustained Detection (1 second)
- **Visual**: Red LEDs loading progressively
- **Trigger**: Movement continues from Stage 2
- **Notification**: None (final verification stage)

#### Alert State: Confirmed Threat (Continuous)
- **Visual**: Solid red across all 16 LEDs
- **Trigger**: Movement sustained for full 3-second sequence
- **Notifications**: 
  - First notification sent immediately
  - Repeat notifications every 5 seconds until movement stops
- **Duration**: Until movement stops or manual disarm

### Mode Indicators
- **DISARMED Mode**: 2 quick green flashes across all LEDs
- **ARMED Mode**: 2 quick red flashes across all LEDs
- **Notification Sent**: 3 purple flashes to confirm alert transmission
- **Touch Detected**: Quick blue flash followed by mode indicator flashes

## Technical Specifications

### Detection Parameters
- **False Positive Prevention**: 3-second continuous movement requirement
- **Movement Timeout**: 500ms gap considers movement "stopped"
- **Auto-arm Delay**: 10 minutes of no movement (configurable)
- **Notification Interval**: Every 5 seconds during alert state
- **Detection Range**: 7-9 meters (360¬∞ coverage)

### LED Effects
- **Rainbow Speed**: Updates every 50ms for smooth animation
- **Loading Speed**: 16 LEDs per second (consistent across all stages)
- **Brightness**: 20% (50/255) for power efficiency and eye comfort
- **Color Accuracy**: Full RGB spectrum with HSV color space

### Power Management
- **Sensor Power**: 2.8mA continuous
- **LED Power**: ~200mA at 20% brightness (all LEDs on)
- **ESP32 Power**: ~80mA active, deep sleep capable
- **Total Active**: ~280mA (suitable for battery operation)

## Software Architecture

### State Machine Design
- **System Modes**: DISARMED ‚Üî ARMED

```

### Hardware Pin Definitions

#define TOUCH_ARM_DELAY 10000  // 10 seconds delay before arming/disarming
```

## Installation & Setup

### Hardware Assembly
1. Connect RCWL-0516 sensor to ESP32 (VIN, GND, OUT ‚Üí GPIO 23)
2. Connect CJMCU-2812B-16 strip to ESP32 (VCC, GND, DIN ‚Üí GPIO 25)
3. **Touch Button Wiring (Plastic Enclosure):**
   - **Wire 1**: ESP32 GPIO 33 ‚Üí Conductive pad/surface (touch electrode)
   - **Wire 2**: ESP32 GND ‚Üí Separate conductive pad/surface (ground reference)
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER connect both wires together!**
4. Add conductive material: Copper foil, conductive paint, or metal plates
5. Power ESP32 via USB-C for development/testing

**Grounding Note**: With plastic enclosure, your body becomes part of the capacitive circuit when you touch the conductive pad.

### Software Setup
1. Install PlatformIO IDE or Arduino IDE
2. Clone this repository
3. Install required libraries (FastLED automatically via platformio.ini)
4. Upload code to ESP32
5. Open serial monitor at 115200 baud for debug output

### Testing
1. **Boot Test**: Rainbow chase effect confirms initialization
2. **Disarmed Mode**: Continuous rainbow indicates normal operation
3. **Auto-arm Test**: Wait 10 minutes, system should show red flashes
4. **Detection Test**: Wave hand near sensor, observe 3-stage loading sequence
5. **Alert Test**: Sustain movement for 3+ seconds, confirm solid red and notifications
6. **Ground Test**: Check serial monitor for touch values:
   - **After fixing wiring**: 50-80 when not touching, <40 when touching
   - **If still 0**: GPIO 33 still shorted to GND - check solder joints
   - **If >100**: No ground connection - ensure GND wire is properly connected
   - **If TOUCH DISABLED**: GPIO 33 is still shorted - fix wiring
7. **Touch Calibration**: Monitor serial output for touch values, adjust TOUCH_THRESHOLD if needed
8. **Touch Test**: Test both ARM and DISARM scenarios:
   - **When DISARMED**: Touch + release ‚Üí blue flash + progressive purple loading (10s countdown)
   - **During countdown**: Touch again ‚Üí red flash (canceled)
   - **Wait 10s**: Green/red flashes (armed)
   - **When ARMED**: Touch + release ‚Üí immediate green/red flashes (disarmed)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **No LED response**: Check 3.3V power and GPIO 25 connection
- **No motion detection**: Verify RCWL-0516 VIN power and GPIO 23 connection
- **Slow rainbow**: Normal - updates every 50ms for smooth animation
- **No auto-arm**: Check 10-minute timer, ensure no movement detected
- **Missing notifications**: Verify 3-second sustained movement requirement
- **Touch not working**: Check if GPIO 33 is connected to screw AND GND has proper reference
- **Touch values stuck at 0**: GPIO 33 is DIRECTLY connected to GND - remove the direct bridge
- **TOUCH DISABLED message**: GPIO 33 is shorted to GND - fix wiring connections
- **Touch values always high**: No ground reference - ensure GND is connected properly
- **Touch too sensitive/insensitive**: Adjust TOUCH_THRESHOLD value (lower = more sensitive)
- **Touch erratic**: Check GND connection quality and metal surface cleanliness

### Debug Output
Monitor serial output at 115200 baud for detailed system status:
